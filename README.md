# Smartphone Recommender System
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements a Content-Based Recommender System for smartphones. It recommends smartphones based on their specifications and user preferences.

# Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends smartphones similar to the ones a user has already liked based on specifications.
Data Analysis: Includes steps to preprocess and analyze smartphone data.
Similarity Metrics: Utilizes similarity measures (e.g., cosine similarity) to rank recommendations.

Usage
Load your dataset of smartphones (including features like brand, processor, RAM, etc.).
Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess data and compute recommendations.
Modify the similarity metrics or features as needed.
Dataset
The dataset should include relevant smartphone attributes. Example columns:

Brand Name
Processor
RAM & Storage
